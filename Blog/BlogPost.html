      </h1>

      <p class="text1">
        A century of fire suppression has reshaped our forests. The floor is
        littered with material that is dense, dried, and dead. Now, climate
        change is highlighting why that’s a problem.

      <p class="text2">
        The way we heat our homes and buildings is one of the biggest
        contributors to climate change. But a solution may actually come from
        the rush of consumers looking to buy AC for the first time. They're a
        huge potential market for a different kind of system — the electric heat
        pump.

      <p class="text3">
        In the last century, 85% of the world’s oyster reefs have vanished. And
        we’re only recently beginning to understand what that’s cost us: While
        they don’t look incredibly appealing from the shore, oysters are vital
        to bays and waterways around the world.
